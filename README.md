# React To-Do Application

This repository contains a simple To-Do application built with ReactJS, demonstrating proficiency in front-end development concepts such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React components, hooks, and state management using Redux.Users can add, view, and delete tasks easily.

# Live Demo

You can view a live demo of the project [here](https://react-to-do-list-app-project.netlify.app/).

## Features

- **Task Addition:** Users can input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button or pressing Enter.
- **Task Viewing:** All added tasks are displayed in a list format.
- **Task Deletion:** Each task has a delete button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.
- **Functional Components:** The application is built using functional components, leveraging React hooks (useState, useEffect) for state management.
- **State Management with Redux:** Redux is used to manage the application's state, including storing and updating tasks.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed:** Users can mark tasks as completed without deleting them, offering additional task management capabilities.
- **Persistent Storage:** Implemented persistent storage (e.g., local storage) ensures that tasks are saved even if the page is reloaded or the browser is closed.
